# Children of IE

Nth-child is annoyingly not supported by Internet Explorer 8 and below. But Internet Explorer 7 and 8 support *other* selecors that can be used to the same effect as nth-child. Children of IE is intended to mimic as much nth-child functionality as possible in IE 7 and 8.

### Inspired by:

http://abouthalf.com/2011/07/06/poor-mans-nth-child-selector-for-ie-7-and-8/

## Installation

In your terminal type:

```
gem install children-of-ie
```

In your Compass `config.rb` file write:

```
require 'children-of-ie'
```

In your stylesheet write:

```
@import "children-of-ie";
```

## Usage

Use :nth-child() functions as you normall would but instead wrap nth-child() in escaping characters like so:

```scss
p:nth-child(3)      {} // normal nth-child
p#{nth-child(3)}    {} // children-of-ie nth-child
```

n+ strings are supported as well.

```scss
p:nth-child(n+3)    {} // normal nth-child
p#{nth-child(n+3)}  {} // children-of-ie nth-child
```

Works just fine without a selector as well.

```scss
:nth-child(2)       {} // normal nth-child
#{nth-child(2)}    {} // children-of-ie nth-child
```

Other strings are NOT supported.

```scss
p#{nth-child(3n)}   {} // STRING NOT SUPPORTED
p#{nth-child(odd)}  {} // STRING NOT SUPPORTED
p#{nth-child(6n+4)} {} // STRING NOT SUPPORTED
```
